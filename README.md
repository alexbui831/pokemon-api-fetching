## React Axios tailwind.css app learning how to use REST API services using Poke API to create an Pokedex website that allows you to search through all currently available Pokemon provided through the Poke API.

## Problems Overcame:

## Using useState method to have certain features toggled such as which way the pokemon's img is facing, allowing the user to flip through every pokemon available and showing previousPokemon and nextPokemon images

## Figuring out how to properly use .map method to loop through an array of objects that had nested objects inside of the objects. In order to solve this I took out a piece of paper and wrote out the Array by reading the JSON data and thought of a simple solution. The JSON data looked like TYPES:[{"SLOT":1},"TYPE":{"NAME":"GRASS","URL":"URL"},{"SLOT":2},"TYPE":{"NAME":"POISON","URL":"URL"}]
